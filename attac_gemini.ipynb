      "AI-Managed Urban Gravity Storage (G-Store):\n",
      "Concept: A compact, modular energy storage system for commercial buildings (or city centers) that uses gravity (lifting and dropping heavy blocks or water) instead of traditional batteries. An AI system optimizes the lifting/dropping schedule based on real-time grid prices and renewable supply (e.g., storing solar power during the day to use at night).\n",
      "Uniqueness: Focuses on a non-chemical, scalable, and safe storage solution specifically for dense urban environments where large battery farms are impractical.\n",
      "Personalized Thermal Energy Exchange (P-Tee):\n",
      "Concept: A geothermal-based HVAC system using ultra-small, closed-loop heat pumps that are embedded into the foundation of individual homes or small subdivisions during construction. It uses the stable temperature of the earth to provide highly efficient heating and cooling.\n",
      "Uniqueness: Moves beyond large, centrally drilled geothermal systems to offer a standardized, low-cost, plug-and-play thermal solution for the residential construction market.\n",
      "Agri-Waste Biofuel Synthesis (Bio-Pellet Pro):\n",
      "Concept: A service that partners with large-scale farming operations to convert their specific, difficult-to-dispose-of agricultural waste (e.g., nut shells, corn husks, straw) into high-energy-density biofuel pellets or briquettes for industrial boilers or home heating.\n",
      "Uniqueness: Solves both a waste management problem and a fossil fuel dependency problem by creating a decentralized, localized fuel supply from underutilized biomass.\n",
      "Drone-Powered Wind Turbine Blade Repair (Aero-Fix):\n",
      "Concept: A specialized service using autonomous drones equipped with precision repair tools and advanced imaging to inspect, clean, and perform minor composite material repairs on wind turbine blades while the turbine is spinning at low speed.\n",
      "Uniqueness: Drastically reduces turbine downtime and the high cost of manual inspections/repairs by eliminating the need for scaffolding, cranes, or full stops.\n",
      "Kinetic Footprint Flooring (Kine-Tile):\n",
      "Concept: Develop and install piezoelectric or electromagnetic kinetic energy-harvesting tiles in high-traffic commercial areas like shopping mall entrances, airport hallways, and subway turnstiles.\n",
      "Uniqueness: Captures the often-wasted kinetic energy from human movement and converts it into small-scale, localized electricity to power emergency lighting, information screens, or charging stations within the building.\n",

      "This is a one-pan wonder that minimizes cleanup and uses minimal oil.\n",
      "Concept: Chicken breast and hearty vegetables are tossed in a simple, bright marinade and roasted together.\n",

      "Why it's Healthy: Lean protein and a high volume of nutrient-dense vegetables are cooked with minimal fat.\n",
      "2. Mediterranean Chicken Bowl with Quinoa\n",
      "A fresh, satisfying meal that focuses on lean protein and whole grains.\n",
      "Concept: Seasoned, cubed chicken is quickly pan-seared and served over a bed of quinoa, topped with a fresh salad mix.\n",
      "Key Ingredients: Chicken breast, cooked quinoa (or brown rice), cherry tomatoes, cucumber, pitted kalamata olives, red onion, and fresh parsley.\n",
      "Dressing: A simple vinaigrette made with olive oil, red wine vinegar, and a squeeze of lemon.\n",
      "Why it's Healthy: High in protein and fiber (from the quinoa), and rich in heart-healthy fats (from the olive oil) and fresh antioxidants.\n",
      "3. Quick Chicken and Black Bean Fajitas\n",
      "A high-protein, veggie-packed, and customizable meal that's ready in minutes.\n",
      "Concept: Sliced chicken and bell peppers are sautéed with Mexican spices, then served in whole wheat tortillas or as a bowl over shredded lettuce.\n",
      "Key Ingredients: Sliced chicken breast, sliced bell peppers (red, yellow, green), onion, black beans, and fajita seasoning (or cumin, chili powder, and paprika).\n",
      "Healthy Toppings: Pico de gallo (or salsa), a dollop of plain Greek yogurt (in place of sour cream), and fresh avocado or guacamole.\n",

      "Machine learning is a broad field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that uses algorithms to parse data, learn from it, and make a decision or prediction.\n",
      "Feature Extraction: ML models require human experts to manually identify and code the features (attributes) used to classify the data. For example, to classify an image of a cat, a programmer must tell the system exactly what features to look for: \"long ears,\" \"whiskers,\" and \"furry tail.\"\n",

      "Deep learning is a specific type of machine learning that uses neural networks with three or more layers (hence \"deep\").\n",
      "Automatic Feature Extraction: DL models do not require human-defined features. They use their complex network structure to automatically learn and extract the features directly from raw data (like pixels in an image or raw audio).\n",
